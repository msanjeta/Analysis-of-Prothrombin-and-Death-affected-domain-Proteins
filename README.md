# Analysis-of-Prothrombin-and-Death-affected-domain-Proteins

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

To analyze and align two different proteins in terms of their sequence, structure and function.

METHODOLY:

To solve bioinformatics problems, sequence data retrieval is crucial. The primary goal of this process is to determine the evolutionary relationship between functional regions in a sequence and sequences from different organisms.

The proteins chosen are Prothrombin and Death-effected domain protein. Both proteins' FASTA sequences were retrieved. Both proteins were analyzed to see if they had any similar functions.

DATABASES USED:

1) Using Pairwise Sequence Alignment, you can identify regions of similarity between two biological sequences that can determine functional or structural relationships.
2) In RasMol, proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules are visualized using molecular graphics. With PredictProtein (PP), you can search public sequence databases, create alignments, and predict protein structure and function aspects.
3) During evolution, secondary structures are much more conserved than sequences. PyMOL is a multiplatform molecular graphic tool widely used to visualize macromolecules in 3D.
4) The Swiss-PDBViewer (aka DeepView) provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing multiple proteins simultaneously. The proteins can be superimposed in order to derive structural alignments and compare their active sites.

All the results are done and put in a document file, which is uploaded.
